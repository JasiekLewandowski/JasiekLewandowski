## Hello! 👋 

##### Huh! 💦 It's really hard to break through the crowds of other juniors, I'm so happy you found my repository! 
<br/>
My name is Jasiek Lewandowski and I am... the Filmmaker-Programmer-Man!!! 🌌
Even though I don't wear a cape and tight suit and I spend most of my day in front of the computer, that doesn't mean I can't do cool stuff 💥
My superpowers are programming 💻 and Adobe Creative Suite 🎆

#### Current front-end flag projects:
- 💫 [Interstellar Mouse Trail Effect](https://github.com/JasiekLewandowski/SpaceMouseTrail) 
  
- 🔴 [Bubble Animated Backgroud + Mouse Trail Effect](https://github.com/JasiekLewandowski/AnimatedBubbleCanvasAndMouseTrail) 

## I invite you to view my projects, where I present my greatest works. 
And if you think this is not enough, I challenge you to come back here in a few weeks. 
I'm sure I'll have some new projects that I'll surprise you with 💣
